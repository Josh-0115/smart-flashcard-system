curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/flashcard -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"student_id":"stu001","question":"What is photosynthesis?","answer":"A process used by plants to convert light into energy"}'
```
Retrieve flashcards example:
```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/get-subject?student_id=stu001&limit=5"
